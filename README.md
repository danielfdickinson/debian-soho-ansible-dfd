# DFD Debian SOHO via Ansible

Bare-metal and virtual machine management via Ansible for a 'SOHO/KOHO
infrastructure' cluster, including mail server, groupware, and web hosting.

The virtual machines are presumed to have been previously deployed. The author
is currently using [Ansible to deploy a VM cluster on
Libvirt](https://gitlab.com/danielfdickinson/debian-libvirt-ansible-dfd).

This repository should not include any unencrypted private or even particularly
personalised information. It does, however, depend on adding some (to be
documented) variables and supplying them to Ansible vaults.

It is designed for DFD's uses and is likely not a 'plug and play' option for
others. It is Daniel's hope, however, that it still proves informative and
useful.
